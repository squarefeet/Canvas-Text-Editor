	Conditions
	----------
	Cursor doesn't go past end of line
	Cursor doesn't go before start of line

	Insert new characters at cursor position
	remove characters from (cursor position - 1)
	on ENTER, split line at cursor position
		Place cursor at beginning of split string

	Arrow key up will go to end of line if previous line is longer than one above it
	Arrow key down will go to end of line if previous line is longer than one above it

	Arrow key up will stay in same X position if next line is longer or same length than one below it
	Arrow key down will stay in same X position if next line is longer or same length than one above it.




	LINE STRUCTURE
	--------------
	[
		['a','b','c',':', ' '],
		['f', 'u', 'n', 'c', 't']
		...etc.
	]


	Character Structure
	-------------------
	A line such as:
	'hello'
	will be treated as:

	'hello|'

	Where '|' is the cursor. currentChar in this example will be 'o', or index 4 (base zero). So it's a look
	behind, not a look ahead.
